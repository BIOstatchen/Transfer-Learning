# GAMM:GRS-informed gene-based association mixed model
# Background
Integrative eQTL hierarchical Cox (IEHC) is a R procedure for examining the association of a set of genetic variants based on genes under the framework of mixed models. Very similar to the popular MiST method which conducts the burden and the variance components test to binary or continuous outcome. IEHC uses Integrative eQTL hierarchical Cox model to test for the association by testing both the burden and the variance components according to the survival risk outcome.
